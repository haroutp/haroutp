### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a self-taught individual with a lifetime of grit and perseverance. For years, I aspired to become a software developer. I educated myself through a mixture of MOOCs and bootcamps which lead me to my first internship. I struggled and persevered, but I wasnâ€™t able to meet requirements. My team lead advised me that starting as a QA engineer might be a better stepping stone for me.

Based off that experience, I now aspire to become a QA engineer. Iâ€™m currently enrolled in a variety of specializations on Coursera related to Java, Python, and Software Testing & Automation. I will also be attending a Software Testing (QA) Specialist bootcamp that is on par with ISTQB standards.

If you have any advice or information was someone breaking into the QA engineering world, please reach out!
